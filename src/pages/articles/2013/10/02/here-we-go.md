Finally I'm doing it!

Welcome to the first published article / post / whatever-you-call-it of my personal site / blog!

I've been wanting to make something like this for quite a while, but never manage to find the time to do it.. until now!

Here, you will find whatever I feel like posting spanning from topics about:

- my highly opinionated view about life;
- Ruby on Rails,
- Android,
- Mobile Phones,
- Games,
- the Japanese language;
- basically anything that comes to my mind.

So.. it is a blog...

Well, yeah, mostly.. But, being an active programmer at heart, I'll also be using this site as my lab! So, expect new stuffs to come out, and existing stuffs to broke. Hey, it might even develop unexpected features (read: bugs)!

I will also published some of my portfolio here later, be sure to check them when it comes. :)

So, until next time! Meanwhile, I'll be adding more exciting stuff!
