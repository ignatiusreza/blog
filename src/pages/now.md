### I'm building something

Sustainability is a major question in open source, and I want to help find the answer somehow. I think, one reason why it is so hard to answer is how open source (anything on the internet for that matter) appear to be faceless. What we see when interacting with open source are code and text, instead of people. I want to build something which may help bring the people side of it up front.

In short, I'm building a set of tools which would help analyze project's dependencies and return the list of people who help in making the project possible. What would this list be good for? To be honest, I'm not sure. At the very least, it helps turning your dependencies from "packages" to "people". But, what good will it bring to the maintainer? Will it help them fund their work? will it help bring in contributors? I don't know. I guess, I'll figure that part out later once it is build. :grin:

### We're looking to move

I've been living in Japan for more than 5 years, and now I'm ready to move somewhere else.

I'm particularly interested in moving to somewhere in Europe. So, if you're working for European company and is looking for help, feel free to contact me. Note that I do have several preferences:

- I've been working with Rails and Javascript (jQuery, React) for most of my professional years, but, I'm also highly interested in extending my skill set to include Elixir, Elm, and Rust

- I love working with open source, and I want to continue contributing to open source in some shape or form

- Sustainability is a must, I love what I'm doing, so as much as possible, I want to avoid getting burn out

### Should I write a book or two?

I randomly got some idea for books which could be interesting, should I write them?

- What If: There's no Sport

  Unpopular opinion, but I'm not a big proponent of sports in general, World Cup, Olympics and such doesn't excite me. Which got me thinking, what if they never exists in the first place? How different would the world be?

- The Origin of Things - What Were They Thinking?

  I'm sure that at one point or another, you've wondered things like: what were the first person who discover that cow milk are drinkable thinking?
